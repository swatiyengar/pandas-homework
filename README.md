# Homework 05: Pandas

## What the assignment was about
 
**Part 1: Animals:** This assignment reviewed basic functions and methods of the 'pandas' and 'matplotlib' libraries 
**Part 2: Billionaires:** This assignment applies 'pandas' to a dataset about the world's billionaires

## Something you learned in the process

- Chaining methods in pandas

## Something you found challenging 

- Modifying plot aesthetics. R's ggplot2 seems a bit more flexible than matplotlib. I had several issues trying to set categorical axes using matplotlib.
